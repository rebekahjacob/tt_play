My very boring Tidy Tuesday. Just don't have enough time.

``` {r}
library(tidyverse) #data management
library(viridis) #for colors
library(hrbrthemes)

commute_mode <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-11-05/commute.csv")

mode_by_size<- commute_mode %>%
  group_by(city_size, mode) %>%
  summarise(Percent=mean(percent))
mode_by_size
```

``` {r}

ggplot(mode_by_size, aes(fill=mode, y=Percent, x=city_size)) + 
     geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete=T, option="C") +
    ggtitle("Avg. % of Population Bike/Walk by City Size") +
  labs(x="City Size", y="Average Percent")

```
